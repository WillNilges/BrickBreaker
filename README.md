### Developing in Monogame

There are two ways to install Monogame on your machine.

The first method is to install the monogame extension in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). To do this, download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). When you open the program, you will see a screen that propts you to create or open a project. In the right column, underneath the button to create a project, there will be an option to continue without code. Click on that. Next, go to the navbar at the top of the program, and click on the **extensions** tab. In the dropdown, click on **manage extensions**. Use the search bar in the top right corner to search for **Monogame**. Find the result called **MonoGame Framework C# Project Templates**. Click on it, and click download.
